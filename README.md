Statistical Learning Project:

Overview-
This project, Census Income Classification, aims to predict income levels above or below $50,000 using U.S. Census data from 1994. Utilizing logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, it explores the impact of demographic and socio-economic features on income. 
Extensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and performance evaluations help assess each modelâ€™s predictive accuracy and interpretability, with SVM achieving the highest precision. This project provides insights into income determinants and demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical learning techniques on structured socio-economic data.
