1. Project Setup and Initialization
Development Environment: Set up Visual Studio Code with necessary Python extensions and libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.).
Team and Project Information: Document project title, objectives, team members' names, and relevant information.
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Acquisition: Download and source the census data or other relevant datasets.
Data Loading and Initial Analysis: Load the data and perform preliminary analysis to understand its structure, check for missing values, and identify the types of variables.
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data Cleaning: Address missing values, remove duplicate entries, and discard irrelevant data points.
Initial Feature Engineering: Begin transforming categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., through one-hot encoding or label encoding) and consider normalizing or standardizing numerical features. This stage might also include reducing dimensionality or parsing dates.
4. Advanced Feature Engineering
Creating New Features: Develop new features that could improve model predictions. This can involve aggregating columns, engineering interaction terms, or incorporating domain knowledge to create variables that capture underlying patterns or relationships not evident in the raw data.
Feature Selection: Employ techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance metrics from model outputs, or wrapper methods to select the most relevant features for modeling. This step aims to reduce overfitting and improve model interpretability.
Dimensionality Reduction: Consider methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for datasets with high dimensionality to simplify the models while retaining most of the variance in the data. This can be particularly useful for visualizations and reducing computational load.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization and Statistical Analysis: Use visualizations (histograms, pair plots, box plots) to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the dataset. Perform statistical tests to understand the distributions and relationships between variables.
6. Model Building and Evaluation
Model Implementation: Manually implement machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM. Understand and code the algorithms from scratch, focusing on the underlying mathematics.
Training and Evaluation: Split the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Adjust models based on performance.
7. Model Optimization and Finalization
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with model parameters to enhance performance. Identify the best-performing model for making predictions on new data.
8. Documentation, Reporting, and Code Review
Documentation: Throughout the project, document findings, decisions, and insights. Provide a comprehensive conclusion that summarizes the model's performance, its limitations, and potential future improvements.
Code Organization and Peer Review: Ensure the code is organized, well-commented, and adheres to best practices. Seek feedback from peers or mentors to refine the project further.
Integrating Feature Engineering as a distinct phase underscores its critical role in the machine learning pipeline, enabling the construction of more complex and accurate models by effectively capturing information from the dataset.
